## ****************** Experiment Overview ****************** 
Experiment 2 focuses on the application of the NumPy Library. This experiment allowed me to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a NumPy Library.

### This experiment is comprised of 2 problems, namely: 
(1) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - where a 5x5 ndarray with random elements is stored to variable X, and this ndarray is normalized.

(2) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - where the SQUARES of the first 100 positive integers are the elements of a 10x10 ndarray, and from this ndarray, all elements divisible by 3 are saved.

## ********************* Coding Process *********************
For Problem 1, 
> The "np.random.random((x,y))" function is used and stored to variable x to generate the 5x5 random element ndarray. 
> Once the ndarray is generated and stored to "x", the next step is to get the MEAN and STANARD DEVIATION of the ndarray. That can be done by using the "x.mean()" and "x.std()" functions, which are then stored to y and z, respectively.
> The final step is to
