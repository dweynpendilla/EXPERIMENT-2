## ****************** Experiment Overview ****************** 
Experiment 2 focuses on the application of the NumPy Library. This experiment allowed me to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a NumPy Library.

### This experiment is comprised of 2 problems namely: 
(1) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - where a 5x5 ndarray with random elements are stored to variable X, and this ndarray is normalized.

(2) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - where the SQUARES of the first 100 positive integers are the elements of a 10x10 ndarray, and from this ndarray, all elements that are divisible by 3 are saved.

## ********************* Coding Process *********************
For Problem 1,
